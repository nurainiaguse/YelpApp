# Project 3 - *Yelp*

**Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

-  Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
-  Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
-  Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

   - Infinite scroll for restaurant results.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Add more view controllers such as details and map to show location
2. Utilize the auto layout more efficiently and learning more in depth on how to master it

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

Figuring out how to implement infinite scroll and understanding how to use the offset API took a while.
